# Info
This is just an attempt to "solve" the board for particular strategies.

Since this is a NP problem, these are not 'optimal' solutions. Rather these are solutions that are 'good enough' in that 500,000 iterations could not do better.

If you have a slower computer, it will only run for 5 mins max. If this terminates by time, it will likely be a worse solution than if it terminates by temperature reaching 0.10.

# Instructions:
### Windows 
- users can find the exe in the dist folder, simply run that and click the cells that you can't build on for your run. Then set the maximum number of oasis you want (max 50) and hit start.

### Everyone Else
- You will have to either compile it yourself or just run it using python3.
- If you don't know how to do this, then I am sorry but I probably won't help.
- If someone else compiles for other OS I will add it to the dist folder and update this.
